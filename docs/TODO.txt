TODOs and Plans
===============

General
-------
 - Teach Brad git
 - Decide whether to pursue tablet idea

Enclosure

Current:
 - Rig lights to be in consistent, stable position

New, laser-cut:
 - Add holder for Pi
 - Add cable routing for HDMI, etc.?
 - Add reinforcement/support/bracing for bottom?


Software
--------

Features:
 - Save video (if possible)
 - Save frame (and result of background subtraction) when status first becomes
   "missing" for troubleshooting
 - Report m/s velocities in analyze.py (requires figuring out best way to get
   different position data (frame- and tank-coords and tank phys size) into
   analyze.py...)
 - Utility to create an .ini file interactively (w/ camera view, clicking,
   etc.)

Testing/validation:
 - Record a few real-world videos of fish w/ new setup and correct .ini files
   to match
 - Check carefully how invalid entries ['lost'] will affect collected metrics

Bugs:
