TODOs and Plans
===============

Fishremote Image
----------------
 - https://github.com/Drewsif/PiShrink/

Enclosure
---------
Wait on these until we start looking at monitor stimulus again:
 - Integrate frameless LCD display
 - Add cable routing for HDMI, etc.


Circuits
--------
 - Any way to assemble the circuits w/o soldering?  Currently, the headers have to be soldered on the sensors.
   * Sensors sold w/ headers pre-soldered?
   * Other ways of making connections to the 0.1" spaced holes?


FishWeb / Analyze
-----------------
 - :?: When does the data output/recording start?  How is that indicated?
 - Experiment progress indicator should know when timing actually started


FishBox [.py]
-------------

Big / Important:
 - Switch to pigpio library for PWM -- runs separate daemon as root, all rest
   as unprivileged user.
   - OR switch to latest kernel w/ /dev/gpiomem access... see if wiringpi will use it.
 - Make background subtractor adaptive, modifying sensitivity to hit 1
   detection exactly. (See babyfish code.)

Medium:
 - Utility to create an .ini file interactively (w/ camera view, clicking,
   etc.)
 - Save video (if possible)
 - Report m/s velocities in analyze.py (requires figuring out best way to get
   different position data (frame- and tank-coords and tank phys size) into
   analyze.py...)

Testing/validation:
 - Check carefully how invalid entries ['lost'] will affect collected metrics

BUGS:
