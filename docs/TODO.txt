TODOs and Plans
===============

General
-------
 - Teach Brad git
 - Decide whether to pursue tablet idea
 - Consider / keep in mind idea of setting up a centralized control/logging server
 - Investigate light level sensor for interior of box

Enclosure
---------

Double-check:
 - Height of tank vs light position

New, laser-cut:
 - Add opening / holder for light/temp sensors
 - Add cable routing for HDMI, etc.?


FishWeb / Analyze
-----------------

Compute general statistics to be used for identifying startle response
and/or behavior change in "absolute" darkness:
 - Mean, median, max of:
   - x position
   - y position
   - speed
   - x speed
   - y speed
   - acceleration magnitude
   - x acceleration magnitude
   - y acceleration magnitude

Bugs:
 - Fails to reanalyze sometimes? (Reported by Brad - need to check)
 - Crashes (sounds like) on reanalyze all when some traces are "missing"? (Reported by Brad - need to check)


FishBox
-------

Features:
 - Save video (if possible)
 - Save frame (and result of background subtraction) when status first becomes
   "missing" for troubleshooting
 - Report m/s velocities in analyze.py (requires figuring out best way to get
   different position data (frame- and tank-coords and tank phys size) into
   analyze.py...)
 - Utility to create an .ini file interactively (w/ camera view, clicking,
   etc.)

Testing/validation:
 - Record a few real-world videos of fish w/ new setup and correct .ini files
   to match
 - Check carefully how invalid entries ['lost'] will affect collected metrics

Bugs:
