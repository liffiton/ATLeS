Measuring resistance through H2O between two pieces of Al foil:  multimeter says >2MOhm.

Current:
  * Measured by DMM with voltage set on power supply
  * With Al foil on **inside** of plastic baffles, right at baffles:
    * 32V -> 75mA
    * 20V -> 47mA
    * 15V -> 35mA
    * 10V -> 22mA
    * 5V  -> 10mA
    * 2V  ->  3mA
  * With Al foil on **outside** of plastic baffles (only conductance via thin gaps at edges):
    * 20v -> 16mA
  * Baffles **block a lot**
