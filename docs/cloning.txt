To save a disk image of a working/configured Raspberry Pi SD card:

  1) Put card into card reader in a Linux machine.
  2) 'sudo umount /dev/[device of auto-mounted partition[s]]'
  3) Use gparted to shrink the root partition on the card to just
     the used space plus a small buffer.
  4) [how?] determine the number of blocks now occupied.
     e.g.: http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/a/8314
  5) Use dd | gzip to create the image using the size from the previous step.
     e.g.: sudo dd bs=???? count=???? if=/dev/sdd1 | gzip > rpi_image_`date +%d%m%y`.gz
