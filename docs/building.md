# Building an ATLeS Box Enclosure

The ``designs`` folder in the ATLeS repository contains source files for nearly all of the parts required to build an ATLeS box enclosure.  In the ``designs/box/box_structure.scad`` is an [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/) 3D model of the enclosure.  DXF files suitable for laser-cutting can be created using ``make`` (requires OpenSCAD), and pre-generated DXF files are provided in ``designs/dist``.

The enclosure was designed to be laser cut from 1/8" [hardboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardboard).  Other sheet materials suitable for laser cutting (e.g. plywood or acrylic) may work with small modifications to the design to account for different material thickness.
