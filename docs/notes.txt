Overview
--------

The end goal is to make a Skinner box for zebrafish.  The box will sense the fish's position and give the fish visual feedback based on its position and the history thereof.

Tanks are roughly 30cm x 15cm x 5cm (just guesses).  Position sensing will be on the x-y (30cm and 15cm) axes.  Feedback will be presented on one side of the tank in the same plane.


Input
-----

Spec:
 * Resolution of 100 positions across (longest dimension) is fine.  10x10 would be workable.
 * Realtime sensing and feedback
 * Ideally: automatic detection of position and orientation of tank within frame.
   * For consistent, scaled coordinates across experiments

Ideas:
 * Camera
   + Simple hardware -- cheap, easy to put together
   - Issues with glare, filtering, etc.
 * IR Camera (rpi)
   + Simple hardware
   + IR sensitivity / filtering (http://publiclab.org/wiki/near-infrared-camera)
   * Note: RPI Python OpenCV V4L2 stuff: http://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=43&t=65026&start=25
 * Photosensors
   + More robust (?)
   - More complex -- have to custom build it

Automatic position/orientation detection:
 * Apply markers to 4 corners of tank (at bottom and at water line)
   * Differentiate by color?  (possibly easiest)
   * Use a unique pattern?
 * Detect prominent lines in tank and find 4 lines w/ most appropriate ratios/slopes to be the tank

Output
------

Ideas:
 * Monitor
   + Most flexible -- any image/animation can be displayed
   + Simple hardware -- no construction required
   - Cost (potentially)
   - Issues with glare, filtering, given the camera is facing the display
 * Matrix of LEDs
   + Potentially easier to filter out
   + Inexpensive
   - Requires custom building
   - Low resolution


Plan
----

Webcam for sensing, monitor for feedback.


Software
--------

Interface needs:
  * Setup
    * ???
  * Monitor
    * Time experiment started, time running
    * View experiment parameters?
    * View current data?  (Form?)
    * Current video feed
      * Ideally live video, but a current still should be alright
  * Control
    * Stop experiment
  * Download
    * Data from previous experiment
    * Data from all past experiments
    * Data from selected experiment(s)
    * ?Form?

Interface options:
  * Web-based or GUI app
    * Web-based most accessible
    * GUI app runs where?  Via SSH?  Or physically at the machine itself?
  * Per-box or single centralized
    * Per-box is actually simpler to setup, maintain
    * Single centralized could be more usable

Data:
  * ???Form???
  * Centralized database?
    * Would be useful, but adds a lot of complexity

Feedback:
  * Animations?
    * If so, run in a separate thread
    * Thread 1: Track fish and make feedback decisions
    * Queue for messages, thr1->thr2
    * Thread 2: Animation, responding to messages in queue

API flow:
  frame = cv2.get...
  proc.proc(frame)
  tracker.update(proc.centroids)
  track.store(tracker.position)
  feedback.update(track)

General coding:
  * Use logging package, log any uncaught exceptions (crashes):
      http://blog.tplus1.com/blog/2012/08/05/python-log-uncaught-exceptions-with-sys-excepthook/
  * Animation:
     * Use pyprocessing for animation?
       http://code.google.com/p/pyprocessing/
     * Or use pyglet directly?
     * Pyprocessing will likely be easier for others to use for making new 'plugins'.
  * Use multiprocessing.{Process|Queue} for 'threading' and communication
  * Setup a 'plugin' architecture, with a directory for 'feedback' plugins and a directory for 'trigger' plugins?

**OR**
Build on pre-existing software:
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_behavioral_experiment_software
  * Python:
    * OpenSesame looks feature-rich
      * Uses PsychoPy or Expyriment for backends
    * PsychoPy also has a graphical experiment builder
    * Expyriment is code only, and it might not offer much we need...

Scripting options:
  * Let users create experiments in raw Python
  * Use a graphical editor like OpenSesame or PsychoPy (or one of those directly)
  * Blockly!  Can export to Python.  Can likely create custom blocks for various functions/variables of interest...!
