Installing an Updated OpenCV on the Raspbery Pi
===============================================

The following instructions assume an updated Raspbian system.

Based on:
  http://docs.opencv.org/doc/tutorials/introduction/linux_install/linux_install.html


Build dependencies
------------------

Packages that need to be installed in addition to the defaults.  [There may be something missing here that isn't included in the default Raspbian install, but this is what I had to add to my current setup.]

    cmake
    libgtk2.0-dev
    python-dev
    libavcodec-dev
    libavformat-dev
    libswscale-dev
    libjpeg8-dev
    libpng12-dev


Build instructions
------------------

In the opencv-2.x.xx directory:

  mkdir release
  cd release
  cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local -D BUILD_EXAMPLES=off -D BUILD_TESTS=off -D BUILD_PERF_TESTS=off ..

Make sure "OpenCV modules">"To be built" lists python; make sure "GUI" has "YES" for GTK+; make sure "Python" section lists correct paths to binaries/libraries.
Tests, examples, and performance tests are not built to save space.  It takes far too much space with those enabled (I ran out of space with 1.1GB free to start).

  make

Takes about 4 hours on the RPi B+.

  sudo make install
