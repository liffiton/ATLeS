FishyCam
========

Overview
--------

The end goal is to make a Skinner box for zebrafish.  The box will sense the fish's position and give the fish visual feedback based on its position and the history thereof.

Tanks are roughly 30cm x 15cm x 5cm (just guesses).  Position sensing will be on the x-y (30cm and 15cm) axes.  Feedback will be presented on one side of the tank in the same plane.


Input
-----

Ideas:
 * Camera
   + Simple hardware -- cheap, easy to put together
   - Issues with glare, filtering, etc.
 * Photosensors
   + More robust (?)
   - More complex -- have to custom build it

Spec:
 * Resolution of 100 positions across (longest dimension) is fine.  10x10 would be workable.
 * Realtime sensing and feedback


Output
------

Ideas:
 * Monitor
   + Most flexible -- any image/animation can be displayed
   + Simple hardware -- no construction required
   - Cost (potentially)
   - Issues with glare, filtering, given the camera is facing the display
 * Matrix of LEDs
   + Potentially easier to filter out
   + Inexpensive
   - Requires custom building
   - Low resolution


Plan
----

Webcam for sensing, monitor for feedback.
