New features:
 - Save video (if possible)
 - Save frame (and result of background subtraction) when status first becomes
   "missing" for troubleshooting
 - Utility to create an .ini file interactively (w/ camera view, clicking,
   etc.)

Testing/validation:
 - Record a few real-world videos of fish w/ new setup and correct .ini files
   to match
 - Check carefully how invalid entries ('lost') will affect collected metrics
