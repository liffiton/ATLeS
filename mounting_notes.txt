Mounting the Raspberry Pi and Camera
====================================

Requirements
------------

  * Camera must be held in correct orientation (i.e., right-side-up).
  * Camera must be facing fish tank.
  * Camera should be as close to a set distance from and orientation w.r.t. the fishtank as possible.
  * Raspberry Pi must be within flex-cable-range of camera.
  * SD card, USB, HDMI, and ethernet must all be accessible on RPi.
  * Monitor should be mounted in set position w.r.t. fishtank.
  * All should be splash-proof (for whatever direction splashes might come from).

Ideas
-----

Monitor:
  * VESA mount would accomodate most regular monitors, but:
    * Most regular monitors are larger than needed
    * There are two(?) VESA standards
    * Even w/in same monitor size, VESA mounts are likely not all in same position on monitor
  * Specific smaller monitor
    * E.g.: https://www.adafruit.com/products/1287 ($150ish)
    * Requires mounting monitor and control board

Construction:
  * Clear acrylic
    * Camera, Pi, monitor(?) mounted w/ simple bolts through mounting holes
    * Holes in acrylic drilled *or* laser-cut
    * Simple, splash-proof from direction of tank
    * ? How to hold two pieces of acrylic (w/ some load) vertically in correct position?
      * Threaded rod?  Seems good.
      * Acrylic side pieces as well?  Then could be 100% laser-cut.
    * ? How to position fishtank?
      * Bottom piece of acrylic w/ laser-cut slots for tank "feet"?
      * Cut piece for holding outline of tank in place?
  * Full enclosure for Pi/Camera

    * E.g.: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:142608
    * E.g.: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:89745
    * Note remixes of above, as well
    * Cleaner, but not entirely needed...
    * But definitely better protection for electronics...

Questions
---------
  * Lighting?  Need sufficient for camera.  Does it need to be constant / standard for any experiments?
